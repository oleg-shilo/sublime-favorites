Features/Changes:

1. Added commands for all major operations
2. Issues #2: Allow favorites.txt file to be created per-project, at project root
3. Issues #3: Allow favorites.yml as alternative to favorites.txt
    By default the items in the favorites panel appears with their file name listed. However if a custom name is more beneficial a file alias can be assigned to the item in the data file via "Edit favorites" command.

    The format is simple: <file_alias>|<file_path>:
    ```
    shelloverlay|Q:\Extras\Utils\TortoiseIconOverlays.cs
    ```
4. Issues #4: Allow opening all favorites with a single command
